										<h1>People of the Cascio Lab</h1>
										<p>We are a cool group of kids. We do awesome science. We also play laser tag and do other fun stuff like that. Let us tell you a little bit about ourselves:</p>
										
										<h2>Principal Investigator</h2>
										
										<h3>Dr. Michael Cascio</h3>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
												<p>Dr. Cascio is a cool guy. He lives in Highland Park with his family and enjoys vacationing in California. </p>

										<h2>Graduate Students</h2>
										
										<h3>Elizabeth Castellano</h3>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
												<p>Liz is a sixth-year graduate student. Her project is using crosslinking mass spectrometry studies to identify distance constrains and generate refined models of SERT. She grew up in El Paso Texas, moved to Columbus Ohio at the age of 15 then moved to Pittsburgh in 2013 to start grad school. Liz got married in August 2013 and gave birth to her daughter Diana Evelyn in January 6th 2017. She enjoys spending time with her family and playing with her daughter. She likes watching movies specifically action and romantic comedies. She likes almost any sport and enjoys riding her bike.</p>

										<h3>Nicholas Ferraro</h3>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
												<p>Nick is a fifth-year graduate student in the Cascio Lab. His project looks at cholesterol interactions with the glycine receptor in different allosteric states using tandem mass spectrometry. Nick earned his undergraduate degree from Washington and Jefferson College. He enjoys running the mass spectrometer and finding different ways to utilize the instrument to solve problems. Outside the lab, Nick enjoys working on his cars, exercising, and enjoying nature. He enjoys traveling around the region to different parks and attractions. He hopes to one day be able to use the skills he learned at Duquesne to help make a difference.</p>

										<h3>Kayce Tomcho</h3>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
												<p>Kayce is a fourth-year graduate student in the Cascio Lab. Her project entails refining allostery and the structure of the glycine receptor by using systematic single-cysteine mutations and crosslinking-mass spectrometry. She would like to use her degree to teach biochemistry and immunology at an undergraduate institution. Kayce is originally from Corry, Pennsylvania and received her undergraduate degree from Slippery Rock University. Outside of Duquesne, Kayce is a supporter of the World Wildlife Fund, The Ocean Conservancy, and the ASPCA. Her very favorite thing is her cat, Kat. In her spare time, she enjoys reading and writing, music (especially Billy Joel), gardening, arts-and-craft-type-things, and sometimes, running. </p>
