									<h5>Dr. Ellen Gawalt</h5>
									<p>Dr. Gawalt attended Duke University as an undergraduate. There she was a member of the varsity swim team and conducted undergraduate research in bioinorganic chemistry. She moved onto Princeton University for graduate school where she earned her Ph.D. focusing on the surface chemistry of metal oxides. Dr. Gawalt completed a two-year post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Chicago working on reaction kinetics at surfaces and the cellular response to surface changes. Her research group currently focuses on the surface chemistry of biomaterials and improving the tissue-material interaction. She is a member of the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and has won the University Creative Teaching Award and the BSNES Excellence in Teaching Award. She grew up in Northern Virginia and she and her family currently reside in the Shadyside section of the city.</p>

									<h5>Lauren Bell</h5>
									<p>Lauren is a sophomore biochemistry major at Duquesne. She is in the honors college, pre-med health professionals program and is a member of the womens soccer team. Her project deals with the characterization of the surface of stents. Specifically, she is looking at the alloy SS316L, a common stent material, and working toward coating the surface with anti-platelet drugs.</p>

									<h5>Katherine Harry</h5>
									<p>Katherine is a rising senior from Slippery Rock University participating in the URP-chemistry REU for the summer 2018. She is majoring in chemistry with a concentration in biochemistry. She is working in the Gawalt lab at Duquesne in collaboration with Dr. Min Soo Lim from Slippery Rock. She is working with fully hydrogenated and fully fluorinated stearic acid SAMs on the surface of sapphire coupons. Using AFM, friction measurements are being taken to analyze how fluorinated SAMs affect packing and therefore friction and stability. There is the possibility for this research to be applied in nano-technological systems, as well as biomedical implants.</p>
